//! Extension discovery for SPEL programs.
//!
//! Scans the consuming program's **direct** dependencies (path, git, or
//! registry, resolved by [`crate::dep_walk`]) for crates that declare
//! `[package.metadata.spel]` in their `Cargo.toml`. Each qualifying
//! crate contributes through one entry point:
//!
//! - `discover_extensions` returns an [`ExtensionDiscoveries`]: the
//!   cross-crate `#[instruction]` fns to be merged into the consumer's
//!   dispatcher and IDL, the gate param inject specs applied by
//!   [`apply_wrap_and_inject`], the wrap configs, and any embedded-mode
//!   declarations from the module markers. Producers apply
//!   [`rewrite_embedded_roles`] before the wrap and inject passes so an
//!   embedded role resolves to the consumer's own account; discovered
//!   fns get their role params substituted and their `bound_args`
//!   trailing params stripped, with the dispatcher filling the values
//!   as literals invisible to the IDL. Gate and
//!   marker attrs stay on emitted handler fns and expand there as
//!   ordinary proc-macros: a gate rewrites the handler body, a marker
//!   expands to nothing. Nothing is stripped.
//! - [`check_duplicate_instruction_names`] rejects name collisions
//!   between user fns and discovered extensions (or two extensions)
//!   before they become colliding enum variants, match arms, or IDL
//!   discriminators. All producers run it after assembly.
//!
//! # Trust model
//!
//! Activating an extension takes two explicit consumer actions: the
//! dependency listed in the consumer's own `Cargo.toml` and the marker
//! attr on the `#[lez_program]` module. Discovery is deliberately not
//! transitive, so a dependency of a dependency can never contribute
//! instructions by claiming a matching `extension_attr`. Generated
//! cross-crate call paths use the dependency's `[package].name`, never
//! its directory name.
//!
//! # Failure tiers
//!
//! Malformed `[package.metadata.spel]` (a key with the wrong shape) is a
//! hard `Err`: callers surface it as a compile error, a broken extension
//! declaration must never degrade to a program silently missing its
//! extension surface. Environmental issues (unreadable manifest, path
//! dep pointing at a missing directory, a matched extension contributing
//! nothing) are reported through the `on_warning` channel, following the
//! `find_path_dep_dirs` precedent — with one exception. A candidate
//! marker that matched no discovered extension makes
//! [`resolve_program_deps`] hard-error regardless of why: a typo or a
//! transitive-only dependency under healthy resolution, or a git or
//! registry extension that cannot be located once dependency resolution
//! loses the cargo metadata layer. Compiling a program that may be
//! silently missing its extension surface is the one failure this
//! mechanism cannot afford. When every candidate marker matched a path
//! dependency, resolution degradation stays a warning and the build
//! proceeds.
//!
//! Feature-gated identically to [`crate::idl_gen`]
//! (`#[cfg(feature = "idl-gen")]`) since it depends on `syn` and `toml`.
//! Internal helpers (`read_spel_extension_attr`,
//! `read_spel_inject_specs`, `collect_instruction_fns`,
//! `discover_extensions`) are module-private; producers go through
//! [`resolve_program_deps`].
